# Five Recent - WP Plugin Concept
This was a weekend project to build a concept: WordPress options page that runs entirely through [React](https://reactjs.org). It should **not** be used in production since there is very little sanitation going on via the client.

## Installation
In a terminal (I use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) and love it), navigate to your local WordPress' plugin folder:
```bash
$ cd /path/to/wordpress/plugins/
```

From there, clone the repo and `cd` into the root folder for the React app:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cjkoepke/five-recent.git && cd five-recent/view
```

Install the dependancies and generate a build. You can either do this via [npm](https://npmjs.org) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):
```bash
$ yarn install && yarn build
```

After this is done, you can activate the plugin in your WordPress dashboard.

## Usage
Once you've built and activated the plugin in your local WordPress installation, you'll see a new submenu appear under Posts:

![Navigation Submenu for Five Recent](https://github.com/cjkoepke/five-recent/tree/master/docs/navigation.png)

Once there, you can do the following:

- Change the **Post Title**.
- Change the associated **Featured Image**.
- **Delete** the Post.

Each of these will happen without refreshing the page, but will be persisted to the server. Try it out!

## Tools
I bootstrapped the view layer of this project with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I highly recommend this as a starting point, no matter your expertise â€” you can always eject your app later if you want access to the build pipeline and Webpack.

Beyond that, I utilized the following dependencies:

#### Node WPAPI
From the docs: "An isomorphic JavaScript client for the WordPress REST API that makes it easy for your JavaScript application to request specific resources from a WordPress website."

This client seriously rocks. It's super easy to do just about anything you would do with PHP. This particular app passes a nonce instance to the React WPAPI instance to verify the logged in user.

[See Documentation](http://wp-api.org/node-wpapi/)

#### Component File Picker
A really simple, intuitive component to handle file uploads without having to use the `<input type="file">` interface (which can make things ugly).

[See Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/component-file-picker)
